    <h2>Vision &amp; Identity</h2>
    <p>I’m not just a chef. I’m an artist and systems architect who’s spent 25 years redesigning how kitchens, operations, and supply chains actually work. I thrive at the intersection of culinary creativity, technology, and efficiency — building structures that let teams do more with less, without stripping away the soul of hospitality.</p>
