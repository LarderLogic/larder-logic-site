The kids pour into the classroom, chattering. Wendy walks up and starts talking to Red and Annie.</em><strong>Wendy</strong></p><p>I can't believe it's been two weeks since I've seen you guys. What have you been doing?&nbsp;<em>[Bebe walks in]</em><strong>Bebe</strong></p><p>Hey guys.<strong>Wendy</strong></p><p>Hey Bebe.<strong>Bebe</strong></p><p>You guys, uh,&nbsp;<em>[holds out her arms]</em>&nbsp;notice anything different?&nbsp;<em>[looks down at her body]</em><strong>Wendy</strong></p><p><em>[the three girls gaze]</em>&nbsp;Oh my God, Bebe. You got boobs!<strong>Bebe</strong></p><p>Yeah, they started coming in last week. At first I thought they were just mosquito bites, but, then they didn't go away.<strong>Mr. Mackey</strong></p><p><em>[enters the classroom and walks past the girls]</em>&nbsp;M'kay, kids, let's take our seats, m'kay?&nbsp;<em>[the girls take their seats]</em>&nbsp;I know this has been a difficult couple of weeks for you all with the untimely death of your teacher, but it's time for us to try to move on and learn, m'kay?<strong>Cartman</strong></p><p>Mr. Mackey, I don't think I'm over the teacher's tragic death yet. I need more time. It's just... it still hurts, you know? Can I go home?<strong>Mr. Mackey</strong></p><p>No. Eric, what we're gonna do is learn to&nbsp;<em>hide</em>&nbsp;our emotions with math problems.&nbsp;<em>[turns, grabs some chalk, and starts writing on the board]</em>&nbsp;M'kay, so let's start with some multiplication tables over here, m'kay. First we'll do, uh, 4x4, m'kay?<strong>Kyle</strong></p><p>Dude, look at Bebe.&nbsp;<em>["We'll move into the 5x thing." Bebe is busy taking notes. "We'll try 5x3..."]</em>&nbsp;Something seems different about her.<strong>Stan</strong></p><p>Yeah, I noticed that too. Did she get a haircut or something?<strong>Kyle</strong></p><p>I don't know.&nbsp;<em>[Bebe continues writing]</em><strong>Clyde</strong></p><p>Hey, Tolkien. You know, I never really noticed before, but that girl Bebe is... kinda cool.<strong>Tolkien</strong></p><p>I was just thinking the same thing. It's like, she's a girl, but, she's someone you could hang out with.<strong>Butters</strong></p><p><em>[pipes up behind Annie]</em>&nbsp;Yeah. Bebe is kinda cool, huh?&nbsp;<em>[Bebe continues writing]</em><strong>Cartman</strong></p><p>Hey Craig, is that the same shirt that that Bebe chick always wears?<strong>Craig</strong></p><p>I don't know. Why?<strong>Cartman</strong></p><p>It just... it just seems like a really awesome shirt.<strong>Craig</strong></p><p>Yeah. It kinda does.&nbsp;<em>[Bebe continues writing, but stops and looks to her right. All the boys are staring at her, all the girls look at the board.]</em><strong>Mr. Mackey</strong></p><p>Okay, and so uh,&nbsp;<em>[Bebe is looking back, wondering why the boys keep staring at her]</em>&nbsp;so who can tell me the answer to the first problem, 6x8?
